I did undergraduate studies in theoretical physics. I specialized in the study of complex systems (Msc Complex Systems Physics, Sorbonne Universit√©), i.e. a training based on statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes and numerical methods to simulate complex systems.
I did a PhD in the laboratory for Computational Neuroscience at CNRS (group of A. Destexhe), where I studied the circuit and cellular features regulating population dynamics in the neocortex using theoretical and experimental approaches.
I was then a postdoctoral fellow in the Neural Coding laboratory at the Italian Institute of Technology (group of T. Fellin & S. Panzeri) where I worked on cortical dynamics during wakefulness (see ). and in the Neuroinformatics laboratory at CNRS (group of A. Davison).
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working on a collaborative project involving the groups of cellular and circuit physiology in the Paris Brain Institute (ICM, groups of N. Rebola and A. Bacci).

## My research

As a general research line, my scientific work focuses on understanding how the dynamics of neural networks in the cerebral cortex can underlie the rich repertoire of computations performed by the brain of mammals.

More specifically, my research investigates the functional role of the ongoing dynamics in the cortex, e.g. the primary visual cortex (the first cortical stage after the retina) displays a massive amount of visually-unrelated activity, why ?
Previous research has shown that the behavioral context in which an animal stands controls the dynamical regime of cortical network activity. 
My research focuses on understanding the circuit and biophysical properties controlling to understand charcterizing how those shifts in dynamical regimes and which in turn, determines how the network will process incoming information.
This property is a striking feature of cortical computation: cortical processing is not a fixed operation purely determined by the input, it is a strongly flexible process controlled by the dynamical regime of cortical networks. 
The comparison with the current state-of-the-art of artificial intelligence nicely illustrate the non-trivial aspect of this property. In computer vision, the input-evoked activity represents 100% of the network activity in an artificial neural network trained to discriminate images. 
In contrast, the sensory-evoked activity is only a weak fraction of the network activity in the primary visual cortex of a mammal, and the evoked response shows a rather high variability over image presentations. The "state-dependent" nature of cortical computation is therefore a fascinating topic, whose function remains largely enigmatic.

This research line has two important applications. First a biomedical application. Indeed, characterizing neural computations in the healthy brain will allow to understand how complex psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, leads to cognitive dysfunction as a result of the (sometimes subtle) alterations in the network processing of information. Second, this drives advances in biologically-inspired artificial intelligence. In particular this research suggests specific algorithms to make artificial systems capable of the flexibility characterizing mammalian behavior.

## Open Science

I am commited to Open Science in my research work. I am a convinced believer that open data and open source software is a major driver and a necessary condition for scientific progress.

In the era of data-intensive research, this however comes at the cost of important efforts during the research process. 
Data needs to be standardised to be [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible). I do spend a lot of energy in the design of such processes and in sharing it with others (see the `physion` software and the `fairgraph` API in [Softwares](./Software.md). All of the data produced by my pipeline are thought to be directly uploaded to modern research data platforms (e.g. https://ebrains.eu) independently from manuscript publication in scientific journals.
