In the lab we pursue scientific excellence in a friendly and highly collaborative atmosphere. We are always looking for talented people to join the team ! 

In addition to the current openings, we might have open positions for Master students, PhD students and Postdoctoral researchers depending on lab space and current funding. Do not hesitate to [contact us (yann.zerlaut@icm-institute.org)](mailto:yann.zerlaut@icm-institute.org), attach your CV and give us a short explanation on your interest in joining the lab.

## Current Openings

### 1) State-Dependent Computations in Recurrent Spiking Networks

#### _Project_

The flexible nature of information processing is a remarkable feature of cognition in the healthy brain.  
Contextual information from either internal (arousal, mood, …) or external (sensory) variables can indeed greatly affect the outcome of diverse cortical processes (perception, decisions, …).
However, despite extensive research, our understanding of how contextual signals modulate cortical information processing remains elusive. 

In this project, the candidate should use theoretical analysis of spiking network dynamics to investigate how modulations of recurrent neural activity can act as a functional "switch" between different modes of information processing. 

Depending on her/his interest, the candidate could also benefit from our [mixed experimental/theoretical research laboratory](https://therebolalab.org) to test modelling predictions using cutting-edge neurophysiological techniques (two-photon imaging, high-densitiy electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, ...) during visual processing in the mouse cortex.

#### _Level_

**Postdoc** or **PhD**

#### _Profile_

Graduate students or postdoctoral fellows with background in either computational neuroscience, physics, applied mathematics or quantitative/theoretical biology are primarily encouraged to apply. But highly motivated candidates of all profiles will be considered.
