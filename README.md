**Welcome to my personal webpage !**

I am a researcher in **Computational Neuroscience** at the [Paris Brain Institute (ICM)](https://institutducerveau-icm.org/). I study the *principles of information processing in cortical networks* by combining approaches and tools from [Theoretical Neuroscience](./README.md#Theoretical_Neuroscience), [Data Science](./README.md#Data_Science), [Data Engineering](./README.md#Data_Engineering) and [Software Engineering](./README.md#Data_Science).


In the laboratory (teams of [Nelson Rebola](https://therebolalab.org) and [Alberto Bacci](https://baccilab.org)), we combine this computational approach with experimental characterization (optophysiology, electrophysiology) and experimental manipulations (genetic deletion, chemogenetics, optogenetics) of brain activity.

## Theoretical Neuroscience

I work on models of cortical activity at the cellular and network scale. I use analytical approaches together with numerical simulations to study the emergent properties of those systems. Various examples of such theoretical modelling work can be found in my [publication list](./publications.md).

## Open Science

Being a convinced believer that **open data and open source software is a major driver and a necessary condition for scientific progress**, I am commited to [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) in my research. 

In the era of data-intensive research, this however comes at the cost of important efforts during the research process. 
Data needs to be [standardised](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and softwares need to be shared appropriately. 
I do spend a lot of energy in the design and implementation of such processes (see [Softwares](./softwares)).
All of the code and data of my research is made to be directly uploaded to modern research material platforms (such as [Ebrains](https://ebrains.eu)) independently from manuscript publication in scientific journals.

## Data Science 

Our research strongly relies on the use of machine learning to analyze and interpret neurophysiological data. 

I design and implement multivariate models of neural activity from behavioral and sensory features (notably Generalized Linear Models). We use those models to (1) **extract functional principles in the healthy brain** and (2) **characterize functional deficits in disease models of brain activity**.
We also use various machine learning tools such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and dimensionality reduction techniques in the preprocessing of our neurophysiological data.

## Data Engineering

We do data-intensive research. Our experimental approach consists in recording neural activity in the neocortex during behavior using optical imaging (e.g. [2-photon calcium imaging](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00147-1)) and electrophysiology (e.g. [Neuropixels probe recordings](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abf4588)). In practice, this means the processing of massive amounts of data on a daily basis (e.g. the recordings made in [Van Velze et al.](./publications.md) corresponds to the processing of >1TB per day). 

Part of my work consists in the design and maintenance of the preprocessing pipeline for such data.

## Software Engineering

Our original experimental approach and our data management strategy requires the development of custom softwares.

I am the lead developer of [`physion`](https://github.com/yzerlaut/physion): a full software suite for neurophysiology in the context of visual processing in behaving mice. I am a contributor to [`fairgraph`](https://fairgraph.readthedocs.io) a high-level API for metadata management in neuroscientific research. I developed several `python` packages for Data Science applications in the context of neurophysiology.

My full software production is available on my Github profile: [github.com/yzerlaut](https://github.com/yzerlaut)
