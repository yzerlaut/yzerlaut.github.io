**Welcome to my personal webpage !**

I am a researcher in **Computational Neuroscience** at the [Paris Brain Institute (ICM)](). I study the *principles of information processing in cortical networks* by combining approaches and tools from [Thereotical Neuroscience](./README.md#Theoretical_Neuroscience), [Data Science](./README.md#Data_Science)
, [Data Engineering](./README.md#Data_Engineering) , [Software Engineering](./README.md#Data_Science)

## Theoretical Neuroscience

I work on models of cortical activity at the cellular and network scale. I use analytical approaches together with numerical simulations to study the emergent properties of such systems. Various examples of this theoretical modelling work can be found in my [publication list](./publications.md).

In the laboratory (teams of Nelson Rebola and Alberto Bacci), we combine this theoretical work with experimental characterization and manipulations (genetic deletion, chemogenetics, optogenetics) of brain activity.

## Data Science 

Our research strongly relies on the use of machine learning to analyze and interpret neurophysiological data. 
I design and implement multivariate models of neural activity from behavioral and sensory features (notably Generalized Linear Models).
We use those models to extract functional principles in the healthy brain that we compare to models of brain activity in disease models or following experimental manipulation.
We also use various machine learning tools such as Artificial Neural Networks and dimensionalilty reduction techniques in the preprocessing of our neurophysiological data.

## Data Engineering

Our experimental approach consists in recording neural activity in the neocortex during behavior using optical imaging (e.g. 2-photon calcium imaging) and electrophysiology (e.g. Neuropixels probe recordings). In practice, this means the processing of massive amounts of data on a daily basis (e.g. the recordings made in [Van Velze et al.](./publications.md) corresponds to the processing of >1TB per day). 
Part of my work consists in the design and maintenance of the preprocessing pipeline for such data.

This research is a data-intensive research. 

## Software Engineering

This research also requires the development of custom softwares to .

Notably, I am the lead developer of [`physion`](https://github.com/yzerlaut/physion): a full software suite for neurophysiology in the context of visual processing in behaving mice. I am also a contributor to [`fairgraph`](https://fairgraph.readthedocs.io) a high-level API for metadata management in neuroscientific research. My full software production is available on my Github profile: https://github.com/yzerlaut.
