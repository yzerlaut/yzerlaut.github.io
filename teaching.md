## Data Science seminars @ IIT

From 2016 to 2018, I was part of the teaching team in a weekly seminar about the theoretical fundations and the applications of Data Science.

For the conceptual part, the course largely followed the material of the book: [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21606-5) (2009) by T. Hastie and colleagues. For the practical part, we were relying on the `python` ecosystem for data science: `scikit-learn` and `tensorflow`.

## Software Carpentry workshops @ UNIC/CNRS

I took part as an instructor to the sets of [Software Carpentry workshops](https://software-carpentry.org/) held in our research campus (CNRS, Gif sur Yvette) in 2014 and 2015. 

[Software Carpentry workshops](https://software-carpentry.org/) are thourght to be hands-on training covering the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team. 
Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding. 

Over the course of the workshop, we covered the following topics:
- the Unix environment 
- version control with Git
- Data Analysis and Visualization in python
- Numerical Simulations and Modelling in python
