### Yann Zerlaut

I am a _Junior Professor in Computational Neuroscience_ at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). I did a PhD in the laboratory of A. Destexhe at CNRS (Gif sur Yvette, France) and postdoctoral trainings in the Neural Coding laboratory at the Italian Institute of Technology (Genova, Italy), Neuroinformatics group at CNRS (Saclay, France) and Rebola/Bacci laboratories at the Paris Brain Institute (France). In general, I am interested by the fundamental principles of information processing in neuronal networks and their dysregulations in disease.
