### Cibele Martins Pinho 

Cibele is a PhD student in the team, she holds a fellowship from the [DIM C-Brains PhD program](https://dim-cbrains.fr/fr/phd-program/dim-cbrains).  
She received a Bsc degree in Biology and a Msc degree in Neuroscience from the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Brazil.  
Her research focuses on understanding the functional specialization of inhibitory interneurons during development.  
She performs two-photon imaging of neuronal activity across different molecularly-defined populations interneurons in the mouse visual cortex during development. She also analyzes the influence of Autism-related genes in controlling the specificity of interneuronal function.

### Yann Zerlaut

Yann is a _Junior Professor_ in Computational Neuroscience at [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).  
He did a PhD in the laboratory of A. Destexhe at CNRS (Gif sur Yvette, France) and postdoctoral trainings in the Neural Coding laboratory at the Italian Institute of Technology (Genova, Italy), Neuroinformatics group at CNRS (Saclay, France) and Rebola/Bacci laboratories at the Paris Brain Institute (France).  
In general, his research focuses on the fundamental principles of information processing in neuronal networks and their dysregulations in disease.
