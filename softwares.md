I combined the tools I use in my data science workflow in the following suite of `python` packages:
**(1) [`analyz`](https://github.com/yzerlaut/analyz)**. A package for data analysis: a high-level layer on top of `numpy` and `scipy`. 
**(2) [`datavyz`](https://github.com/yzerlaut/datavyz)**. A package for data visualization: a high-level layer on top of `matplotlib`.
**(3) [`finalyz`](https://github.com/yzerlaut/finalyz)**. A package for results dissemination. It allows to build *reports*, *articles* and *presentations* from simple markdown scripts. It is mostly a high-level layer on top of `LaTeX`.
